  <h1>Demand forecasting in automotive production</h1>
  <h2>Material management data analysis for adaptive forecasting in the automotive industry under supply chain
      uncertainty through data-driven modeling and time series aggregation.</h2>
    <div class="project-container">
        <h3>In recent years, the automotive manufacturing sector has faced unprecedented challenges due to global
            supply chain disruptions. Just in the year 2021 alone, the COVID-19 pandemic abruptly halted production and
            shifts in consumer global demand, a six-day blockage of the Suez Canal by the "Ever Given" in March delayed
            shipments for essential car components, and the widespread semiconductor shortages that crippled vehicle
            production well until 2023.
            <br><br>
            These events exposed how fragile the just-in-time manufacturing system could be, and the importance for
            forecasting models that could both assume a relatively stable time series and handle short-term disruptions
            which introduce extreme non-linearity, volatility and abrupt changes in otherwise "predictable" time series
            data.
            <br><br>
            Traditional forecasting models usually struggle to adapt in the face of unexpected schocks and rapid demand
            rebounds which often lead to flawed materials planning, inventory misalignment and production bottlenecks.
            Which highlights the need for more adaptive and resilient forecasting methodologies that can function in
            both short and long term analysis.
        </h3>

        <h3>This project explores an advanced alternative: (Multiple Aggregation Prediction Algorithm (MAPA), proposed
            by Nikolaos Kourentzes in 2014. MAPA enhances forecasting accuracy by combining predictions across multiple
            levels of time aggregation, capturing both short-term fluctuations and medium-term trends.
            <br><br>
            By analyzing historical sales and supply chain signals in the automotive sector, this project demonstrates
            how MAPA can serve as a robust forecasting strategy during periods of instability. This approach is
            particularly well-suited for materials management, where short-term planning accuracy is critical to
            minimizing delays and maximizing throughput throughout a long chain of logistical and manufacturing
            operations that is all too common in the automotive industry.
            <br><br>
            Through this lens, the project integrates data analysis and model experimentation and real-time
            adaptability to <b>Supply Chain Signals</b> like supplier delays, transport lead times and inventory
            levels.
        </h3>

        <h3><b>STEP 1: Business Understanding</b><br><br>

        </h3>

        <h3>
            <b>I. Sales forecasting:</b><br>
            Sales forecasting is used for analyzing sales data and making accurate forecasts, allowing sales teams to
            better teams to better plan their sales efforts and make informed decisions thanks to the help of a variety
            of forecasting models.
            <br><br>
            For <b>Key Performance Indicators (KPI)</b> we'll take into consideration sales performance and forecast
            accuracy which help in measuring the amount of revenue generated from sales over a given period of time and
            helps in measuring the degree to which a sales forecast matches actual sales results.
            <br><br>
            For this project we will look into the sales data of a global company that handles B2B products and
            services, where external factors such as supply chain disruptions or significant economic changes, and
            seasonal trends will be considered.
        </h3>

        <h3><b>STEP 2: Data Understanding</b><br><br>
            Data understanding is focused on covering all activities that may be involved with the problem. In the case
            for our sales forecasting project, we focus on collecting data, examining the data and evaluating the
            quality of data obtained through machine learning algorithms as a means to uncovering patterns that would
            be difficult to identify without using statistical methods.
            <br><br>
            Within sales forecasting, historical data is used to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in past sales
            data. On the other hand, market trends like consumer behavior, competitor activity and economic conditions
            will also be considered even inside B2B sales.
            <br><br>
            For this project, we will create a forecasting ensemble model where the combination of predictions of
            multiple models to create a more accurate forecast, in the hopes of combining the strengths of the
            different models.
            <br><br>
            <b>NOTE:</b> Within this project we won't consider any data quality issues like anomalies or missing data
            as all data is generated specifically for this project.
            <br><br>
            Create an overview of the data involved related to autoparts (consider delivery times, storage times and
            production demand). Involve COVID-Pandemic, the Evergrande Incident, and the Microchip shortage within the
            data. We have to generate ID for product, ID for shipping, planned delivery date,
            availability in storage, quality, demand for the day, country of origin.
        </h3>

        <h3>Now let's continue by considering the following available data sources obtained from a B2B international
            company:<br><br>
            <b>1. Sales data:</b>
            <br><br>
            <b>2. Customer behavior data:</b>
            <br><br>
            <b>3. External market data:</b>
        </h3>

            Use delivery and arrival dates for calculating transport times
            EOQ variable for storage
            Customer demand from forecasting (Bullwhip effect)
        </h3>

        <h3><b>STEP 4: Data Exploration and Visualization</b><br><br>

            ENSEMBLE model MAPA (Multiple Aggregation Prediction Algorithm) with holt-winters, sarima and rnn.
        </h3>

        <h3><b>STEP 7: Model Evaluation and Comparison</b><br><br>
