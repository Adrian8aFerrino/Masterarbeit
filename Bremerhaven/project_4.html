        <h3>In the business world, demand forecasting plays a crucial role in sales planning and strategy. The main
            problem with accurately forecasting customer demand for products and services is the reliance on poorly
            developed forecasting models that lack flexibility and the ability to make informed decisions that take
            into account both internal and external factors that positively or negatively impact sales.
            <br><br>
            Forecasting demand can be a complex task for any type of industry, as it requires a deep understanding of
            market trends, consumer behavior, and external factors that can impact sales. On the other hand, thanks to
            the advancement of machine learning models, forecasting models can achieve fast and accurate results while
            taking into account all possible factors that could influence sales data.
            <br><br>
            George Box, a British statistician, put it best when he said: "All models are wrong, some are useful",
            which is extremely relevant to the world of forecasting. This is because forecasts are sometimes wrongly
            interpreted as predicting something 100% accurately, which in reality is just as possible as using a
            crystal ball in order to into the future.

        <h3>
        </h3>

        <h3><b>STEP 1: Business Understanding</b><br><br>
            <b>I. Sales forecasting:</b><br>
            Sales forecasting is used for analyzing sales data and making accurate forecasts, allowing sales teams to
            better teams to better plan their sales efforts and make informed decisions thanks to the help of a variety
            of forecasting models.
            <br><br>
            For <b>Key Performance Indicators (KPI)</b> we'll take into consideration sales performance and forecast
            accuracy which help in measuring the amount of revenue generated from sales over a given period of time and
            helps in measuring the degree to which a sales forecast matches actual sales results.
            <br><br>
            For this project we will look into the sales data of a global company that handles B2B products and
            services, where external factors such as supply chain disruptions or significant economic changes, and
            seasonal trends will be considered.
        </h3>

        <h3><b>STEP 2: Data Understanding</b><br><br>
            Data understanding is focused on covering all activities that may be involved with the problem. In the case
            for our sales forecasting project, we focus on collecting data, examining the data and evaluating the
            quality of data obtained through machine learning algorithms as a means to uncovering patterns that would
            be difficult to identify without using statistical methods.
            <br><br>
            Within sales forecasting, historical data is used to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in past sales
            data. On the other hand, market trends like consumer behavior, competitor activity and economic conditions
            will also be considered even inside B2B sales.
            <br><br>
            For this project, we will create a forecasting ensemble model where the combination of predictions of
            multiple models to create a more accurate forecast, in the hopes of combining the strengths of the
            different models.
            <br><br>
            <b>NOTE:</b> Within this project we won't consider any data quality issues like anomalies or missing data
            as all data is generated specifically for this project.
            <br><br>
            Create an overview of the data involved related to autoparts (consider delivery times, storage times and
            production demand). Involve COVID-Pandemic, the Evergrande Incident, and the Microchip shortage within the
            data. We have to generate ID for product, ID for shipping, planned delivery date,
            availability in storage, quality, demand for the day, country of origin.
        </h3>

        <h3>Now let's continue by considering the following available data sources obtained from a B2B international
            company:<br><br>
            <b>1. Sales data:</b>
            <br><br>
            <b>2. Customer behavior data:</b>
            <br><br>
            <b>3. External market data:</b>
        </h3>

        <h3><b>STEP 3: Data Preparation</b><br><br>
            Use delivery and arrival dates for calculating transport times
            EOQ variable for storage
            Customer demand from forecasting (Bullwhip effect)
        </h3>

        <h3><b>STEP 4: Data Exploration and Visualization</b><br><br>
            Tests for seasonality
            Distribution of transport times
        </h3>

        <h3><b>STEP 5: Feature Engineering</b><br><br>
            Dummy variables
            Data aggregation
            Data scaling
        </h3>

        <h3><b>STEP 6: Model Building and Training</b><br><br>
            ENSEMBLE model MAPA (Multiple Aggregation Prediction Algorithm) with holt-winters, sarima and rnn.
        </h3>

        <h3><b>STEP 7: Model Evaluation and Comparison</b><br><br>
        </h3>

        <h3><b>STEP 8: Model Refinement</b><br><br>
